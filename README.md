# Gambler's Prayer: An Unfinished Dice game roguelike
Gambler's Prayer is a roguelike dice game that was going to be mix of Yatch Dice (the public domain version of Yatzee) and a Dungeon Crawler, with a similar item system as Balatro and/or the Risk of Rain series of games.

The idea was to play as different characters where each one was going to have different modifiers for the start of the game like more rolls, get more or less money, harder or easier enemies. Then, go through a randomly generated dungeon and use Yatch Dice combos to attack enemies, the higher score you get by rolling the dice, the more damage you do.

## Why is it "Unfinished"
While the game looks polished so far, the problem was lack of time and motivation to finish the project. Having to come up with ideas for enemies, items, and characters and having to build all the necessary systems to build the game on my own, and, having to balance my main and secondary jobs was proving to be difficult.

Plus, this game was mainly inspired by an obsession over Balatro, and while working on this game I noticed more and more roguelikes that are *also* inspired by Balatro with Yatch Dice/Yatzee mechanics. Because of that, I've decided to stop the project to figure out more original or interesting ideas to work on.

## Why publish the code?
Honestly, just to have "something" that I've made out there, even if the game is unfinished and will probably will never be finished. Since the code is now public and under the MIT license (please read below for more info), maybe this will inspire someone to either take some of the ideas for the game and/or build on top of it. Or who knows, maybe I'll finish it in the future as an open source game.
